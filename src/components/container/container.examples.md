### Basic Usage

```jsx
<Container />

```jsx
<Container isFluid />
```

### Widescreen

This container is fullwidth until the `$widescreen` breakpoint. 

```jsx
<Container isWidescreen />
```

### Fullhd

This container is fullwidth until the `$fullhd` breakpoint. 

```jsx
<Container isFullhd />
```
